# HR-analyst-project-Project Description: HR Analyst Project for Employee Performance Prediction
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project designed to predict employee performance based on various HR-related features. The project involves extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, and performance evaluation to identify the key factors influencing employee performance and to build a predictive model that can help HR departments make informed decisions.

Objectives
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and clean a comprehensive dataset of employee records with features such as demographics, work experience, education, performance scores, and other relevant HR metrics.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Extract and create meaningful features that can enhance the predictive power of the model.
Model Development: Develop, train, and evaluate various machine learning models to predict employee performance.
Performance Evaluation: Assess the models' performance using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.
